/// Spoken layout commands, applied deterministically after cleanup.
///
/// Dictation apps handle "new line" / "new paragraph" / "bullet" as commands,
/// not as words. The cleanup model does neither: it was trained on prose, so a
/// dictated "hi john new line thanks for the update" comes back as
/// "Hi John, new line, thanks for the update." This pass turns the phrases into
/// layout after the model, so the model's punctuation around the phrase is
/// absorbed.
///
/// Requests opt in with `CleanupRequest(transforms: [.spokenLayout])`, which
/// applies it to accepted model output. A fallback stays the exact input with
/// no edits; a host that wants the commands honored on a fallback too calls
/// `apply(_:)` or `edits(from:)` on the fallback text itself.
///
/// Pure text → text; no model, no state. A command fires only where speech
/// would have paused around it:
/// - it must be a whole phrase (word boundaries on both sides), and
/// - it must not be the object of a modifier — "the new line of products",
///   "a bullet point", "silver bullet" stay words. Concretely, the word
///   before the phrase may not be an article, possessive, adjective-ish
///   determiner, or "of" (`blockers`).
/// The model's punctuation immediately around the phrase (", new line,") is
/// consumed with it, and the first letter after a break is capitalized.
